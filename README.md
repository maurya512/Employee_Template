# Description
  This project was developed as a part of a homework assignment where the user enters information about their team and the application gives them their team's portfolio.


# Installation Instructions:
  To run this program ensure you have all the necessary node_modules, dependencies and addons required. 
  Basic dependencies such as fs, util, inquirer, async, email-validator and more are sufficient for this program. Once these dependencies are installed we can build our program. 

# Project Original Contributor: 
  This project was assigned to me as a part of a homework assignment. The source code, test files and an organized folder structure was provided to me by the professor and the TAs. I worked solely on running the tests and on the logic behind gathering and sorting the employee's information. 

# Project Test:
  Each js file was individually fixed and ran tests to ensure all files are working in orderly fashion before working on the logic of the program.
